# this part is for including a file which contains
# _globally_ applicable settings for all sub projects of a master project
# (compiler flags, path settings, platform stuff, ...)
# e.g. have vcproj2cmake-specific MasterProjectDefaults_vcproj2cmake
# which then _also_ includes a global MasterProjectDefaults module
# for _all_ CMakeLists.txt. This needs to sit post-project()
# since e.g. compiler info is dependent on a valid project.
# MasterProjectDefaults_vcproj2cmake is supposed to define
# generic settings (such as V2C_HOOK_PROJECT, defined as e.g.
# ./cmake/vcproj2cmake/hook_project.txt, and other hook include variables below).
# NOTE: it usually should also reset variables V2C_LIBS, V2C_SOURCES etc.
# as used below since they should contain directory-specific contents only, not accumulate!
